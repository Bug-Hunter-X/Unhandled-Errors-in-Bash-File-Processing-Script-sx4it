# Unhandled Errors in Bash File Processing Script

This repository demonstrates a common error in bash scripting: improper error handling when working with files. The `bug.sh` script attempts to process a file, but it lacks robust error checks.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or silent failures.  The `bugSolution.sh` script shows how to improve error handling for more robust execution.

## Bug Description

The `bug.sh` script attempts to process the file `my_file.txt`. If the file does not exist, the script fails silently. Even if commands during file processing fail, execution proceeds without notification. This can lead to unexpected output or incorrect results without any indication of an issue.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.sh` script demonstrates improved error handling. It explicitly checks for the file's existence before processing, and the `set -e` option makes the script exit immediately upon any command failure. Additionally, informative error messages are included.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in shell scripts to ensure reliability and prevent unexpected behavior.
